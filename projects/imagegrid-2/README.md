# A very simple Javascript slideshow for Flickr.

Flickrshow is a very simple Javascript slideshow for Flickr. It doesnâ€™t require any web-development expertise, any particular Javascript frameworks, (although it works with all of them), or any hosted web space. It works in all modern web browsers, and Internet Explorer 6.

## Installation & Usage

Flickrshow can display the latest images uploaded to Flickr in less than 40 characters. To add a slideshow to your page just include the script itself and add the code shown in the example below. You can specify the element you wish to contain the slideshow by providing the element ID or the element as a Javascript object.

### Example 1. Displaying recent images with Flickrshow

    <div id="robin">
        <p>Please enable Javascript to view this slideshow</p>
    </div>
    ...
    <script src="flickrshow-7.2.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var robin = new flickrshow('robin');
    </script>
    
In order to customise your slideshow to display your own images you must supply additional settings to the slideshow. The settings used in the slideshow above are shown in the example below.

### Example 2. Supplying options to Flickrshow

    <script>
    var robin = new flickrshow('robin', {
      autoplay:true,
      interval:5000,
      license:null,
      page:1,
      per_page:10,
      tags:'nikonfm2',
      user:'85173533@N00'
    });
    </script>
    
Although Flickrshow does not require JQuery, if JQuery is detected Flickrshow will add a convenient wrapper function allowing you to use Flickrshow as you would any other JQuery plugin.

### Example 3. Alternate usage of Flickrshow with jQuery.

    <script>
    var robin = $('#robin').flickrshow({
      autoplay:true,
      interval:5000,
      page:1,
      per_page:10,
      tags:'nikonfm2',
      user:'85173533@N00'
    });
    </script>
    
## Available Options & Methods

As shown in the example pages above, there are a large number of ways in which Flickrshow can be configured. The following table lists the settings that can be passed to Flickrshow, their default values and a brief description. All settings should be passed as shown in Example 2 above.
